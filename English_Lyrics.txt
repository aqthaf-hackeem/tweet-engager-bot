Take my hand, take my whole life too...🎶
You're still the one I run to, the one that I belong to...🎶
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets...🎶
Even when I lose, I'm winning — 'cause I give you all of me...🎶
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be...🎶
When I fall in love, it will be forever...🎶
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true...🎶
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything...🎶
You're the reason I believe in love...🎶
I just want to dance with you, forever and always...🎶
You’re the one I’ve been waiting for my whole life...🎶
You make loving you easy...🎶
Darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70...🎶
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear...🎶
With every breath, I’m more in love with you...🎶
